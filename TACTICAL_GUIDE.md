# Stormbound Isles - Tactical Gameplay Guide

Based on the mod's backend implementation, here are the key tactical elements that make Stormbound Isles a strategic team-based survival experience:

## Island-Specific Buffs & Tactical Advantages

Each island provides unique tactical advantages through persistent buff auras:

- **Pyrothar (Fire)**: Fire Resistance - Perfect for aggressive players who can resist environmental damage
- **Frostreign (Ice)**: Resistance - General damage reduction, ideal for tank players and defense
- **Sahrakir (Desert)**: Speed - Enhanced mobility for quick raids and escapes
- **Auralis (Mushroom)**: Regeneration - Natural healing for sustained engagements

**Tactical Insight**: Teams must leverage their island's buff to create specialized roles and strategies.

## BUILD Phase - Fortress Preparation

During the BUILD phase, teams are confined to their islands through enforced boundaries:

- Players who leave their island zone receive warnings
- Forced teleportation back to island spawn prevents early aggression
- Deaths during BUILD phase result in revival at your island spawn
- Teams lose points for every death, making defensive building crucial

**Tactical Insight**: This phase is about optimizing base layout, trap placement, and resource stockpiling while minimizing casualties.

## Disaster Management - Environmental Warfare

Each island faces specific disaster types that can be used tactically:

- **Pyrothar**: Meteors and Fire Showers
- **Frostreign**: Blizzards and Ice Spikes  
- **Sahrakir**: Sandstorms and Mirages
- **Auralis**: Spore Clouds and Crystal Storms

**Tactical Insight**: Experienced teams can time raids around enemy disaster periods or use their own disasters as cover for operations.

## PvP Phase - Totem Control is Everything

When the BUILD phase ends and PvP begins:

- **No more automatic revival** - Totems become the only revival method
- **Totem Control = Map Control** - Teams must secure and defend Totems
- **Strategic Death Penalties** - Every death still costs team points
- **Revival Tactics** - Teams must coordinate to revive fallen members at Totems

**Critical Tactical Element**: Totems are the key to survival. Without Totem control, a team cannot revive fallen members, making Totem positioning and defense paramount.

## Advanced Tactical Considerations

### Island Spawn Points
- Islands may have custom spawn points for strategic positioning
- Safe teleportation ensures spawns aren't compromised by enemy interference
- Teams can use spawn positioning for quick access to resources or defensive positions

### Death and Revival Strategy
- BUILD Phase: Auto-revival at island spawn (if available)
- PVP Phase: Manual revival only via Totems
- Each death costs team points regardless of phase
- Killer teams gain rewards for eliminating enemies from other islands

### Boundary Enforcement
- BUILD phase boundaries prevent early aggression but allow for strategic positioning
- Understanding boundary limits helps teams maximize their building space
- Teleportation mechanics can be exploited for quick defensive repositioning

## Winning Strategies

1. **Phase 1 (BUILD)**: Focus on efficient base construction, resource gathering, and minimizing deaths
2. **Phase 2 (PVP)**: Prioritize Totem control, coordinate team movements, leverage island buffs
3. **Throughout**: Manage disaster timing, maintain team points, adapt to enemy strategies

The key to victory in Stormbound Isles is understanding that **Totems are not just revival points - they are the strategic centers of the battlefield**. Control the Totems, control the game.
